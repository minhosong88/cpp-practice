1. Add a checking account class to the account hierarchy
  - Checking account has a name/balance/transaction fee of $1.50 per withdrawal.
  - Every withdrawal will be assessed this flat fee

2. Add a Trust account class to the Account hierarchy
  - Trust account has a name/balance/interest rate
  - deposit works the same as savings account
  - However, any deposit of $5000.00 or more will receive a $50.00 bonus deposited to the account

  The Trust account withdrawal should only allow 3 withdrawals per year and each of these must be less than 20% of the account balance.
  No need to keep track of calendar time. just make 4th deposit fails
