Keep track of what movies people watched and how many times they watched each movie

class Movie - models a movie
- movie name
- movie rating(G, PG, PG-13, R)
- watched - number of times the movie has been watched

class Movies - models a collection of movie objects

Movies need to know about Movie since it is a collection of Movie objects

main driver only interact with Movies class

For example,
- create a Movies object
- ask the Movies object to add a movie by providing the movie name, rating and watched count
- ask the Movies object to increment the watched count by 1 for a movie given its name
- ask the Movies object to display all of its movies

Additionally,
- if we try to add a movie whose name is already in the movies collection, we should display this error to the user
- if we try to increment the watched count for a movie whose name is not in the movies collection we should display this error to the user.
